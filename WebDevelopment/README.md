Backend written using nodejs.

To run, better to delete node_modules directory and replace it by doing "npm install".

To run server, use "node app.js"

Problems facing:
	1> Cannot import background images in css for PUG template engine.
	2> Connection established to MongoDB but data is not being stored rather only id gets generated.
